                My name is Jackson Henry and I graduated from Baylor University 
                with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics. 
                Currently, I work as a Warehouse Associate at Amazon and as an instructor at Mathnasium. 
                In addition, I am hoping to further my skills in coding by 
                learning about software development online and by pursuing the UT Coding Bootcamp.

                One of my hobbies is playing the tuba. 
                For the past 12.5 years, I have been playing tuba in various ensembles. 
                Currently, I play tuba in the Band of the Hills, an all-ages, all skill level community band.

                In addition, I have been involved in the Boy Scouts of America. In 2009, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout.
                Currently, I am an adult leader with Troop 345 in Round Rock, Texas.

                Furthermore, I enjoy learning foreign languages. In addition to my native English, and a working proficiency
                in Spanish, I am currently learning Mandarin Chinese and German. Some of my favorite sites to use are Duolingo
                and Mango Languages.
